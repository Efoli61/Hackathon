Project: Waste Classification and Disposal Locator

Objective: Develop an AI system that classifies different types of waste and informs users of the nearest disposal or recycling bin location.

Waste Categories:

*Glass Waste
*Plastic Waste
*Organic Waste
*Paper Waste
*Metal Waste

How It Works:

Image Upload: Users upload an image of their waste.
AI Classification: The AI system classifies the waste into one of the five categories listed.
Locator Service: The system then provides information on the nearest trash can or recycling bin for the classified waste.
Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Simple image upload and intuitive navigation.
Accurate Classification: Advanced AI algorithms to correctly identify and categorize waste.
Location Services: Integration with maps to pinpoint the nearest disposal or recycling bins.

                                                                                                                      1. What is Climate Change?
                                                                                                                      
Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. This phenomenon is largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases create a “blanket” around the Earth, trapping heat from the sun and causing global temperatures to rise.


2. The Seriousness of the Issue
Climate change is a critical and urgent problem affecting the entire planet. It impacts ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels, posing significant risks to human health, food security, and economic stability. The information available from reliable sources, such as the UN, highlights the extensive consequences and the necessity for immediate action.


3. Triggers of Climate Change
The primary drivers of climate change are fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas. These sources account for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and about 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. Their extensive use exacerbates the greenhouse effect, leading to increased global temperatures and environmental disruption.


4. Strategies to Combat Climate Change
To address climate change, several actions can be taken: support sustainable agriculture to reduce carbon emissions from meat and dairy production, limit air travel, and reduce energy consumption. Additionally, protecting green spaces, consuming less, and discussing climate issues with others are crucial steps. Reviewing and adjusting investments to be more environmentally friendly also plays a role.


5. Personal and Collective Efforts
Both individual actions and collective efforts are essential in combating climate change. By making conscious choices—such as reducing consumption, supporting green initiatives, and advocating for policy changes—we can contribute to mitigating the impact of climate change. Engaging with the community and encouraging widespread action are key to making a significant difference.
